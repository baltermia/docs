> **Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

> Patterns define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

Design Patters are used to ease the life of developers. Each developer should know (at least the basic) design patterns. When planing any software or looking at a software model you will see design models and can understand what the author meant with the designed architecture.

See this Guide: [Refactoring Guru - The Catalog of C# Design Pattern Examples](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/csharp)
