Last but not least we have the Visitor pattern, which is a very important pattern that is commonly used. The pattern separates algorithms from the object in which they operate.

Wikipedia also has a very nice definition of the pattern:

> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

> In essence, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying the classes. Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.

Watch the following YouTube video to get a full and better explanation of the pattern: [Understanding The Visitor Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeZqKnC2gvA).

The Video also addresses *Double Dispatch* which is a technique the pattern uses (it's also mentioned in the Wikipedia article).
