The Flyweight pattern is a pattern used to reduce the used amount of RAM by sharing commonly used objects between other objects. This pattern is most commonly used in games but also finds its use in performance driving application.

The basic concept is to split a object into different parts if some properties are always the same in between other objects of the same type (therefore using less space).
